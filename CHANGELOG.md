## SysInfo version 1.0.0.7b

VERY BIG UPDATE!!!!!!!!!

This version might have skipped a few versions, but it's OK. I have started from scratch since version 1.0.0.3b (which will never be released) and remade the whole thing in WPF and C#. I am so happy about how it turned out. This changed the overall look of the program from a simple, WinForms project to a complicated and beautiful work of art with the help of WPF and some other tools. 'Nuff said, here are the changes:

+redesigned the app from scratch

+used C# instead of VB.NET and WPF instead of Windows Forms

+added a resolution changer

+more interactive style

+Fluent "design"

+more of a Windows-ish style (Settings app)

+more features such as context menus, tooltips, and beautiful design

+added a menu for easy access to common controls

+added the System menu (right-click title bar thing)

+added animations

+added tabs

+added icons to common elements

-removed support for XP

We are investigating an issue with the Performance tab which causes the application to crash on virtual machines (and possibly real machines as well). Stay tuned for fixes.

If you have discovered bugs, please post in Issues.

## SysInfo version 1.0.0.2b (CHRISTMAS UPDATE)

MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMALS!

You might be thinking: "Why did it take 4 days to release this instead of the usual 1 day?"

+replaced radio buttons with checkbox (to make the form less cluttered)

-removed most of the PNG files and replaced it with ICO icons

<sup>* = Performance tab is still in early stages. Please report in Issues if you find any bugs.</sup>
